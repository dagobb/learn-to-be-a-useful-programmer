## Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a web app that runs young programmers through a process which will teach them to make meaningful (and thus paid) contributions to web applications.

[Click here to see the development in progress.](https://iarobinson.github.io/learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer/)

If you're awating anything from me, [please tweet me](https://twitter.com/independentian).

## Workflow

The only way this will work is if I can find a young programmer to work with while developing this system. If you are interested, I'd love to help you learn to code while we build this process.
