## Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a process which will morph those with no programming knowledge to become people who can make meaningful (and thus paid) contributions to web applications.

[Click here to see the development in progress.](https://iarobinson.github.io/learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer/)

## Workflow

The only way this will work is if I can find a young programmer to work with while developing this system. If you are interested, I'd love to help you learn to code while we build this process.

## First Step

Make a pull request on this repository by simply adding your name to the contributor list below. From there we can develop further.

Rough Instructions:
- In your terminal, type `git clone https://github.com/iarobinson/learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer.git`
- `cd learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer` enter the directory
- Open `README.md` in your text editor
- Add your name to the README.md file (replace YOUR NAME HERE with your name in the section below)
- Save the file
- `git push`
- Navigate to `Pull Request` tab
- Your git branch should be clickable
- Create a new pull request
- Once your pull request has been created, I'll figure out the next step :D

BONUS: Bonus points will be awarded to the person who documents their process for writing their name to this repository. Extra bonus points for the person who submits a PR with written instructions on how to add one's name to this repository.

If you don't know how to do that, add an issue using the tab above and I'll create something to move you forward to that step.

## Guide to Requesting Collaborator Status

In order to learn to code, we need to start collaborating on a project

1.

## Gudie to Creating your First Pull Request

1. Sign up for (or sign in to) a github account at `github.com`
2. Use a web browser (ex. Google Chrome or Safari) to visit
        `https://github.com/iarobinson/learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer`
3. Open Terminal Application
        `cmd + spacebar` and type `terminal`
4. In the terminal application, change directory to your desktop
        `cd ~/Desktop`
3. In the terminal application, clone this repository
        `git clone https://github.com/iarobinson/learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer`
4. In the terminal application, change directory into the code repository you just cloned
        `cd learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer`
5. Create a new git branch, but remove YOURNAMEHERE and replace it with your name (Example ianRobinson or sallyMay)
        `git checkout -b YOURNAMEHERE`
6. In the terminal application, open the README.md file
        `open README.md`
7. Your text editor should launch with the README.md file. Change the file by adding your name to the collaborators
8. In your text editor, save your work in the README.md by clicking File>Save or `cmd + s`
9. In the terminal application, type `git add .` - This stages the changes you just made to the file
10. In the terminal application, type `git commit -m "CUSTOM MESSAGE HERE" - This commits your work with a note. You should replace CUSTOME MESSAGE HERE with something that quickly describes your changes
11. In the terminal application, type `git push` - This will generate an error which will give you the command to tell git where to push your code. Copy the command it gives you. For me, it was `git push --set-upstream origin ianrobinson1984/specific_notes_on_creating_a_pr`.
12. In the terminal application, run the code that you found in the error from the previous step. For me it was `git push --set-upstream origin ianrobinson1984/specific_notes_on_creating_a_pr`
13. Use your browser to navigate to the pull request section of this repository
        `https://github.com/iarobinson/learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer/pulls`
14. As you're a collaborator, you should see a browser element which allows you to create a pull request
15. Click `Compare & Pull` button
16. Fill in pull request message and click `Create pull request`
