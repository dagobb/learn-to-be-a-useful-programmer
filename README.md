## Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a process which will morph those with no programming knowledge to become people who can make meaningful (and thus paid) contributions to web applications.

## Workflow

The only way this will work is if I can find a young programmer to work with while developing this system. If you are interested, I'd love to help you learn to code while we build this process.

## First Step

Make a pull request on this repository by simply adding your name to the contributor list below. From there we can develop further.

Rough Instructions:
- In your terminal, type `git clone https://github.com/iarobinson/learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer.git`
- `cd learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer` enter the directory
- Open `README.md` in your text editor
- Add your name to the README.md file (replace YOUR NAME HERE with your name in the section below)
- Save the file
- `git push`
- Navigate to `Pull Request` tab
- Your git branch should be clickable
- Create a new pull request
- Once your pull request has been created, I'll figure out the next step :D

BONUS: Bonus points will be awarded to the person who documents their process for writing their name to this repository. Extra bonus points for the person who submits a PR with written instructions on how to add one's name to this repository.

If you don't know how to do that, add an issue using the tab above and I'll create something to move you forward to that step.

## Gudie to Creating your First Pull Request

3. In the terminal application, clone this repository
        `git clone https://github.com/iarobinson/learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer`
4. In the terminal application, change directory into the code repository you just cloned
        `cd learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer`
5. Create a new git branch, but remove YOURNAMEHERE and replace it with your name (Example ianRobinson or sallyMay)
        `git checkout -b YOURNAMEHERE`
6. In the terminal application, open the README.md file
