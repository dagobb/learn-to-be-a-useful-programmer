# [Useful Programmer - First Git Commit](https://iarobinson.github.io/learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer/)

## Goal

The goal in this project is to allow new programmers to create their first pull request on GitHub. An initial successful PR will be when the new programmer adds their name to the page linked above. The second successful Pr will be when the new programmer adds their individual collaborator page to the page linked above.

This is a simple starter project for early stage programmers.
