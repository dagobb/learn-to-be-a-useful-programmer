## Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a process which will morph those with no programming knowledge to become people who can make meaningful (and thus paid) contributions to web applications.

## Workflow

The only way this will work is if I can find a young programmer to work with while developing this system. If you are interested, I'd love to help you learn to code while we build this process.

## First Step

Make a pull request on this repository by simply adding your name to the contributor list below. From there we can develop further.

Rough Instructions:
- In your terminal, type `git clone https://github.com/iarobinson/learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer.git`
- `cd learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer` enter the directory
- Open `README.md` in your text editor
- Add your name to the README.md file (replace YOUR NAME HERE with your name in the section below)
- Save the file
- `git push`
- Navigate to `Pull Request` tab
- Your git branch should be clickable
- Create a new pull request
- Once your pull request has been created, I'll figure out the next step :D

If you don't know how to do that, add an issue using the tab above and I'll create something to move you forward to that step.
