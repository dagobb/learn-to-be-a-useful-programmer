## Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a process which will morph those with no programming knowledge to become people who can make meaningful (and thus paid) contributions to web applications.

## Workflow

The only way this will work is if I can find a young programmer to work with while developing this system. If you are interested, I'd love to help you learn to code while we build this process.

## First Step: Guide to Requesting Collaborator Status

In order to learn to code, we need to start collaborating on a project.

1. Visit [Issue One](https://github.com/iarobinson/learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer/issues/1) and leave a comment
2. You'll have to wait for me to see your comment and add you as a collaborator.
3. Once I add you as a collaborator, you'll receive an email to join. Click the link in that email.
4. At that point you can make your first pull request. That is the second step, detailed below.

## Second Step: Gudie to Creating your First Pull Request

1. Sign up for (or sign in to) a github account at `github.com`
2. Use a web browser (ex. Google Chrome or Safari) to visit
        `https://github.com/iarobinson/learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer`
3. Open Terminal Application
        `cmd + spacebar` and type `terminal`
4. In the terminal application, change directory to your desktop
        `cd ~/Desktop`
3. In the terminal application, clone this repository
        `git clone https://github.com/iarobinson/learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer`
4. In the terminal application, change directory into the code repository you just cloned
        `cd learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer`
5. Create a new git branch, but remove YOURNAMEHERE and replace it with your name (Example ianRobinson or sallyMay)
        `git checkout -b YOURNAMEHERE`
6. In the terminal application, open the README.md file
        `open README.md`
7. Your text editor should launch with the README.md file. Change the file by adding your name to the collaborators
8. In your text editor, save your work in the README.md by clicking File>Save or `cmd + s`
9. In the terminal application, type `git add .` - This stages the changes you just made to the file
10. In the terminal application, type `git commit -m "CUSTOM MESSAGE HERE" - This commits your work with a note. You should replace CUSTOME MESSAGE HERE with something that quickly describes your changes
11. In the terminal application, type `git push` - This will generate an error which will give you the command to tell git where to push your code. Copy the command it gives you. For me, it was `git push --set-upstream origin ianrobinson1984/specific_notes_on_creating_a_pr`.
12. In the terminal application, run the code that you found in the error from the previous step. For me it was `git push --set-upstream origin ianrobinson1984/specific_notes_on_creating_a_pr`
13. Use your browser to navigate to the pull request section of this repository
        `https://github.com/iarobinson/learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer/pulls`
14. As you're a collaborator, you should see a browser element which allows you to create a pull request
15. Click `Compare & Pull` button
16. Fill in pull request message and click `Create pull request`
