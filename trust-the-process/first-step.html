    <h2>First Step: Guide to Requesting Collaborator Status</h2>

    <p>In order to learn to code, we need to start collaborating on a project.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Visit <a href="https://github.com/iarobinson/learn-to-be-a-useful-programmer/issues/1" target="_blank">Issue One</a> and leave a comment</li>
      <li>You'll have to wait for me to see your comment and add you as a collaborator.</li>
      <li>Once I add you as a collaborator, you'll receive an email to join. Click the link in that email.</li>
      <li>At that point you can make your first pull request. That is the second step, detailed below.</li>
    </ol>
