        <h2>Where I am In My Coding Journey</h2>
        <p>This is the very begining of my coding journey. I am currently a hardwood floor installer/refinisher this has been my occupation for the past 10 years and have decided to move on to something i enjoy. I have always had an interest in computer science, security and programming and have decided to try and move my career in that direction</p>
        <p>I started my coding journey at free codecamp.org. One day I needed help with a solution to one of the quizes there. looked it up on youtube and found Program City to be most helpful and started following the channel. Once i saw him Launching the this project I decided this is exactly what i needed to get some hands on training to help further me in my coding journey.</p>
