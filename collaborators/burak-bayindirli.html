    <h2>Where I am In My Coding Journey</h2>
    <p>I am an engineer in renewable energy industry. I worked in photovoltaic and biogas industries for several years and right now I am on a break and trying to figure out what I want in life. Coding is one of them :)</p>
    <p>I started learning coding in freecodecamp and completed almost the whole js section there. But the problem is even though I finish the tasks I feel like when I try to do something myself I can't. I need some more practical exercises</p>
